# Shared Platters V1 Backup - October 26, 2025

## Reason for Backup
The shared platters flow UX is too basic and needs to be rebuilt from scratch. This backup preserves all work done on the 7-step wizard implementation before starting fresh.

## What Was Backed Up

### Core Components (6 files)
- `guided-planner.js` (73KB) - Main wizard orchestrator with 7 steps
- `wizard-interactions.js` (52KB) - Event listeners and state management
- `wing-customization.js` (14KB) - SHARD-2 wing distribution logic
- `sauce-selector.js` (4.2KB) - Sauce selection UI
- `template-selector.js` (12KB) - Package template cards
- `wing-count-selector.js` (8.2KB) - Wing quantity controls

### Services (3 files)
- `catering-service.js` (6.1KB) - Firebase queries, package normalization
- `catering-addons-service.js` (21KB) - Add-ons categorization and enrichment
- `catering-state-service.js` (17KB) - Centralized state management

### Styles (5 files)
- `catering.css` (92KB) - Main wizard styles
- `wing-customization.css` (13KB) - Wing type cards and distribution
- `sauce-allocation.css` (4.3KB) - Sauce allocation step styles
- `customize-package.css` (9.3KB) - Step 5 customization styles
- `catering-entry-choice.css` (5.0KB) - Entry flow selection

### Documentation (4 files)
- `CATERING-ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md` (24KB) - Comprehensive system review
- `PRICING-INTEGRATION-TEST-SUMMARY.md` (11KB) - Richard's pricing tests
- `STEP-5-PHOTO-CARD-UI-PLAN.md` (16KB) - UI enhancement plan
- `STEP-5-PRICING-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md` (20KB) - Pricing integration roadmap

## System Status at Time of Backup

### Completed Features ‚úÖ
1. **Step 1: Event Details** - Guest count, dietary needs, date/time
2. **Step 2: Package Selection** - Firebase fetch with deduplication
3. **Step 3: Wing Customization** - SHARD-2 wing distribution (boneless/bone-in/cauliflower)
4. **Step 4: Sauce Allocation** - Sauce-to-wing mapping, skip all option
5. **Step 5: Customize Package** - Framework complete, Richard's pricing integrated
6. **Step 6: Add-Ons** - Masonry layout with 8 categories
7. **Step 7: Review & Contact** - Summary display, contact form

### Known Issues üêõ
- Basic text-list UI instead of image-rich photo cards
- No visual hierarchy or engaging product imagery
- Mobile responsiveness concerns
- Loading states missing during Firebase fetches
- No backend quote submission (Firestore write + email)

### Technical Debt
- Step 5 pricing system integrated but UI remains basic
- Phase 0 visual enhancements designed but not deployed
- Hardcoded sauce data removed in favor of Firebase (Oct 26)
- Event listener cleanup issues resolved (Oct 26)

## Architecture Notes

### Data Flow
```
User Input ‚Üí wizardState ‚Üí Firebase Services ‚Üí Render Functions ‚Üí DOM Updates
```

### State Management
- Centralized `wizardState` object in guided-planner.js
- Event-driven updates via wizard-interactions.js
- Firebase real-time data integration

### Pricing System (Richard's Implementation)
- 25-item MODIFICATION_PRICING object
- Tiered removal credits (50%/75%/100% by margin)
- Asymmetric pricing: $12.60 average incentive to keep base items
- 20% removal credit cap + validation

### Firebase Integration
- Collections: `cateringPackages`, `sauces`, `cateringAddOns`
- MCP: firebase-official (project mgmt), firebase-community (CRUD)
- Real-time queries with active==true filtering

## Code Statistics
- **Total Lines**: ~5,000+ lines across all files
- **Components**: 6 major components
- **Services**: 3 Firebase service modules
- **CSS**: ~140KB of styles
- **Documentation**: ~71KB of planning docs

## Restore Instructions
If needed, restore files from this backup:
```bash
cp .archive/shared-platters-v1-backup-20251026/*.js src/components/catering/
cp .archive/shared-platters-v1-backup-20251026/catering*.js src/services/
cp .archive/shared-platters-v1-backup-20251026/*.css src/styles/
cp .archive/shared-platters-v1-backup-20251026/*.md docs/
```

## Next Steps (Fresh Implementation)
1. Analyze what worked well in V1
2. Design new UX with image-rich, modern interface
3. Plan simplified workflow (possibly fewer steps)
4. Build with reusable components from boxed-meals flow
5. Mobile-first responsive design
6. Progressive enhancement strategy

## Lessons Learned
- Text-only UX is not engaging enough for catering
- Need visual product imagery throughout
- Too many steps may overwhelm users
- State management worked well but UI layer failed
- Firebase integration solid, can be reused
