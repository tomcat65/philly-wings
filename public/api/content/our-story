      "content": "This isn't a franchise play. It's Northeast Philly standards: do it right or don't do it. Every order is cooked to order, with \"sauce on the side\" and \"extra crispy\" always an option. We pack in vented, tamper-evident boxes so your wings land hot and crisp — even after the ride."
