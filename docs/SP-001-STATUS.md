## Design Rationale Summary

### Why This Design?

**User Segmentation:**
- Not all catering customers are the same
- Experienced users frustrated by forced questionnaires
- First-timers overwhelmed by too many options upfront

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Don't show all platters until path chosen
- Reduces cognitive load at entry point
- Clear next step based on user's confidence level

**Equal Visual Weight:**
- Side-by-side cards (not tabs or dropdowns)
- Neither path is "default" or "advanced"
- Both presented as valid choices

**Brand Consistency:**
- Matches boxed meals flow visual language
- Same colors, spacing, typography, interactions
- Feels like one cohesive product

**Mobile-First:**
- Stacks naturally on mobile
- No complex responsive behavior
- Touch-friendly (48px+ targets)

**Accessibility Priority:**
- Keyboard navigation built-in
- Screen reader support from day one
- Color contrast exceeds WCAG AA
- Reduced motion support

### Design Validation

**Comparable Patterns:**
- Chipotle: Bowl vs Burrito selection
- Domino's: Easy Order vs Pizza Builder
- Apple: Basic vs Advanced setup
- Sweetgreen: Build Your Own vs Chef Creations

**UX Principles Applied:**
- Clear affordances (entire card clickable)
- Immediate feedback (hover/focus states)
- Reduced anxiety ("takes less than 60 seconds")
- Social proof implied ("experienced customers")

---

## Success Metrics (Future)

Once implemented, track:

**User Behavior:**
- Path selection rate (Quick Browse vs Guided Planner)
- Time to decision (target: <5 seconds)
- Completion rate per path
- Path switching rate (how many change mind?)

**Performance:**
- Time to interactive (<1 second)
- CLS score (0 - no layout shift)
- Lighthouse accessibility score (100)

**Business:**
- Conversion rate per path
- Average order value per path
- Customer satisfaction scores

## Questions for Developer

**Before starting, clarify:**

1. Where should Quick Browse navigate? (All packages view?)
2. Where should Guided Planner navigate? (Smart questionnaire modal?)
3. Should selection persist in sessionStorage?
4. Any existing components to replace?
5. Firebase Analytics events to track?

**During development:**

1. Need design clarification? ‚Üí Ask Sally
2. Technical blockers? ‚Üí Escalate to Claude
3. Integration issues? ‚Üí Check catering-state-service.js
4. Copy changes? ‚Üí All copy in spec is approved

**After implementation:**

1. Deploy to preview environment
2. Test on real devices (iOS + Android)
3. Run Lighthouse audit (accessibility)
4. Get internal feedback (5 users)
5. Track analytics for 1 week

## Next Steps

1. **TomCat65:** Review both design documents
2. **TomCat65:** Ask any questions before starting
3. **TomCat65:** Implement component + styles
4. **TomCat65:** Test locally in emulator
5. **Sally:** Review implementation for design accuracy
6. **Claude:** Coordinate deployment to preview
7. **Team:** Internal user testing
8. **Team:** Iterate based on feedback
