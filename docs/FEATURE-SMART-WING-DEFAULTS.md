# Feature: Smart Wing Distribution Defaults

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Type**: Enhancement
**Impact**: Reduces cognitive load, faster customization flow

## Problem

Wing distribution selector started at **0 / 120**, forcing users to manually distribute ALL wings even though they already made a selection in the conversational wizard ("few-vegetarian", "all-traditional", etc.).

This created unnecessary friction and ignored valuable data already collected.

## Solution

**Pre-populate wing distribution** using smart defaults calculated from the wizard selection.

### User Flow

1. **Conversational Wizard**: User selects "A few people need vegetarian options"
   - Stores: `wingDistributionPercentages: { traditional: 75, plantBased: 25 }`

2. **Package Selection**: User selects "Tailgate Party Pack" (120 wings)

3. **Customization Screen** (NEW BEHAVIOR):
   - Calculates: 120 × 75% = 90 traditional, 120 × 25% = 30 plant-based
   - Smart splits traditional: 60% boneless (54), 40% bone-in (36)
   - **Shows immediately**: 54 boneless + 36 bone-in + 30 plant-based = **120 / 120** ✅

4. **User Can Tweak**: Click presets, use sliders, or keep as-is

## Implementation

### Function: `calculateSmartWingDefaults()`

**File**: `/src/components/catering/wing-distribution-selector.js:544-563`

```javascript
function calculateSmartWingDefaults(totalWings, eventDetails = {}) {
  // Get wizard distribution percentages
  const wizardDistribution = eventDetails.wingDistributionPercentages || {
    traditional: 100,
    plantBased: 0
  };

  // Calculate wing counts from percentages
  const traditionalWings = Math.round(totalWings * wizardDistribution.traditional / 100);
  const plantBasedWings = Math.round(totalWings * wizardDistribution.plantBased / 100);

  // Smart split for traditional: 60% boneless, 40% bone-in
  const boneless = Math.round(traditionalWings * 0.6);
  const boneIn = traditionalWings - boneless;

  return {
    boneless,
    boneIn,
    plantBased: plantBasedWings
  };
}
```

### Integration Point

**File**: `/src/components/catering/wing-distribution-selector.js:33`

```javascript
// Before: Always started at all boneless
const distribution = config.wingDistribution || {
  boneless: totalWings,
  boneIn: 0,
  plantBased: 0
};

// After: Use smart defaults from wizard
const distribution = config.wingDistribution || calculateSmartWingDefaults(totalWings, state.eventDetails);
```

## Examples

### Example 1: "Few Vegetarian" + 120 Wings

**Wizard Selection**: "A few people need vegetarian options" (75% traditional, 25% plant-based)

**Calculation**:
- Traditional: 120 × 0.75 = 90 wings
  - Boneless: 90 × 0.6 = 54
  - Bone-in: 90 - 54 = 36
- Plant-based: 120 × 0.25 = 30 wings

**Result**: `{ boneless: 54, boneIn: 36, plantBased: 30 }` = **120 / 120** ✅

### Example 2: "All Traditional" + 250 Wings

**Wizard Selection**: "Everyone eats traditional wings" (100% traditional, 0% plant-based)

**Calculation**:
- Traditional: 250 × 1.0 = 250 wings
  - Boneless: 250 × 0.6 = 150
  - Bone-in: 250 - 150 = 100
- Plant-based: 250 × 0 = 0 wings

**Result**: `{ boneless: 150, boneIn: 100, plantBased: 0 }` = **250 / 250** ✅

### Example 3: "All Vegetarian" + 120 Wings

**Wizard Selection**: "Everyone is vegetarian/vegan" (0% traditional, 100% plant-based)

**Calculation**:
- Traditional: 120 × 0 = 0 wings
  - Boneless: 0
  - Bone-in: 0
- Plant-based: 120 × 1.0 = 120 wings

**Result**: `{ boneless: 0, boneIn: 0, plantBased: 120 }` = **120 / 120** ✅

## Benefits

### 1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**
- Users see complete plan immediately
- No mental math required
- Can accept defaults or tweak

### 2. **Faster Flow**
- 90% of users expected to keep defaults
- Quick review vs. full configuration
- One-click "Continue" if satisfied

### 3. **Consistency with Preview Anchor**
- Same smart defaults shown in preview
- Matches user expectations
- Reinforces confidence in AI recommendations

### 4. **Respects User Input**
- Uses wizard selection they already made
- Doesn't ignore previous decisions
- Feels intelligent, not redundant

## User Can Still Customize

**All existing controls still work**:
1. ✅ Click preset cards (All Boneless, Classic Mix, etc.)
2. ✅ Use sliders to adjust distribution
3. ✅ Change bone-in style (mixed, flats, drums)
4. ✅ Select cooking method for plant-based (fried, baked)

Smart defaults are just the **starting point**, not a constraint.

## State Tracking

**Source tracking** preserved:
```javascript
{
  wingDistribution: {
    boneless: 54,
    boneIn: 36,
    plantBased: 30,
    distributionSource: 'smart-defaults'  // vs 'manual'
  }
}
```

This allows analytics to track:
- How often users accept defaults
- Which presets are most popular
- Customization patterns by event type

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Few Vegetarian (75/25)
- Package: Tailgate Party Pack (120 wings)
- Expected: 54 boneless + 36 bone-in + 30 plant-based
- Result: ✅ Shows 120 / 120 immediately

### Test Case 2: All Traditional (100/0)
- Package: Northeast Philly Feast (250 wings)
- Expected: 150 boneless + 100 bone-in + 0 plant-based
- Result: ✅ Shows 250 / 250 immediately

### Test Case 3: Half Vegetarian (50/50)
- Package: Game Day Blowout (500 wings)
- Expected: 150 boneless + 100 bone-in + 250 plant-based
- Result: ✅ Shows 500 / 500 immediately

### Test Case 4: No Wizard Data (Fallback)
- Package: Any package
- No eventDetails.wingDistributionPercentages
- Expected: Defaults to all traditional (100/0)
- Result: ✅ Falls back gracefully

## Next Steps

Consider applying same pattern to:
1. **Sauce Selector**: Pre-select from wizard defaults
2. **Dips Selector**: Smart defaults based on event type
3. **Sides Selector**: Pre-populate based on guest count
4. **Beverages**: Auto-calculate based on guests

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/catering/wing-distribution-selector.js`
   - Line 33: Use `calculateSmartWingDefaults()` instead of hardcoded zeros
   - Line 544-563: Added `calculateSmartWingDefaults()` function

**Status**: ✅ Implemented and tested
**Impact**: Significant UX improvement - users see complete plan immediately
**Adoption Expected**: 90%+ will keep smart defaults
