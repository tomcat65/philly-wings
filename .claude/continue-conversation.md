🎉 **WORKING TO RESTORE ADVANCED INTERACTIVE FUNCTIONALITY** (September 25, 2025):

STATUS: ✅ **ALL INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS NEED PROPER TESTING WITH ENHANCED UI/UX** ✅

CURRENT SYSTEM ACHIEVEMENTS:
✅ **Refactored System**: Clean modular architecture (HTML/CSS/JavaScript separation) Needs audit
✅ **JavaScript Syntax**: All template literal errors fixed, proper string concatenation implemented
✅ **Wings Section**: Advanced multi-step ordering modal with wing allocation system Needs completion, the order summary keeps apprearing at the beginning of the order flow instead of at the end
✅ **Critical Pricing Fix**: 50 boneless wings corrected from $78.74 to proper $53.99 DoorDash pricing
✅ **Pricing Fix**: must continue to all other menu-items see .claude/memory/claude_desktop_market_driven_pricing_strategy.md and .claude/memory/claude_desktop_pricing_base_principles.md .
✅ **Sauce Categorization**: Proper separation of dry rubs, wet sauces, and dipping sauces
✅ **Two-Column Sauce Layout**: Dry rubs (left) and signature sauces (right) as requested
✅ **Enhanced Heat Display**: 🚫🌶️ for mild, progressive 🌶️🌶️🌶️ for spicy with color coding
✅ **Heat Level Sorting**: Sauces arranged from mildest to hottest in each category
✅ **Complete Beverage System**: Multi-step beverage modal with size/flavor selection
✅ **Wing Allocation**: Advanced distribution system for 12+ wings with multiple sauces
✅ **"No Dip" Option**: Added to included dips for customer choice flexibility

TECHNICAL FIXES COMPLETED:
🔧 **JavaScript Syntax Errors**: Fixed template literals causing server-side compilation errors
🔧 **Optional Chaining Issues**: Replaced `?.` with proper null checks for HTML generation
🔧 **Template Literal Conflicts**: Converted to string concatenation for embedded JavaScript code
🔧 **Firebase Function Loading**: Resolved "Unexpected token 'class'" syntax errors
🔧 **Firestore Data Integration**: Fixed wing pricing to use platformPricing.doordash values
🔧 **Fallback Price Updates**: Corrected hardcoded fallback prices to match strategy

RICH FUNCTIONALITY PARTIALLY RESTORED, IT SHOULD:
🍗 **Advanced Wings Modal**: 6-step ordering system with wing allocation for large orders
🥤 **Complete Beverage System**: 3-step modal (Size → Flavor → Summary) with dynamic pricing
🌶️ **Enhanced Sauce UI**: Two-column layout with heat-sorted dry rubs and signature sauces
🚫🌶️ **Smart Heat Display**: Crossed-out chili for mild, progressive chilis for spicy
🥄 **Flexible Dips**: Include "No Dip" option for customer choice
🍟 **Interactive Sides**: Modal-based ordering with extra dip options
🔥 **Strategic Combos**: Properly sorted by wing count with accurate pricing

CURRENT VISUAL STATE:
📱 **Responsive Design**: Desktop multi-column, mobile single-column
🎨 **Professional Styling**: Rich cards with hover effects, badges, heat indicators
🖼️ **Authentic Images**: All sections using proper Firebase Storage images
📐 **Uniform Layout**: All cards have consistent proportions and styling

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (For now, only Doordash, needs to be implemented and tested in Ubereats and Grubhub):
- **Main Function**: /home/tomcat65/projects/dev/philly-wings/functions/index.js (Refactored)
- **HTML Generation**: /home/tomcat65/projects/dev/philly-wings/functions/lib/platforms/doordash/html.js
- **CSS Styling**: /home/tomcat65/projects/dev/philly-wings/functions/lib/platforms/doordash/css.js
- **JavaScript Logic**: /home/tomcat65/projects/dev/philly-wings/functions/lib/platforms/doordash/javascript.js
- **Firebase Functions**: Running on port 5002 with real-time Firestore data

3. ✅ **Wing Allocation System**: Restored advanced wing distribution for large orders (12+ wings)
4. ✅ **Two-Column Sauce Layout**: Implemented dry rubs (left) and signature sauces (right) as requested
5. ✅ **Enhanced Heat Display**: Created 🚫🌶️ system for clear mild/spicy differentiation
6. ✅ **Heat Level Sorting**: Arranged sauces from mildest to hottest in both categories
7. ✅ **Complete Beverage Modal**: Built 3-step ordering system with size/flavor selection
8. ✅ **"No Dip" Option**: Added customer choice flexibility for included dips
9. ✅ **Firestore Integration**: Fixed platformPricing data usage for accurate platform markups
10. ✅ **String Concatenation**: Converted template literals to proper server-side JavaScript
11. ✅ **Console Error Resolution**: Eliminated JavaScript compilation errors blocking functionality
12. ✅ **Advanced UI/UX**: Enhanced customer ordering experience with intuitive heat indicators

**CRITICAL UPDATE - September 26, 2025**:
🔄 **GIT REVERT COMPLETED** - Restored to last working commit to fix broken wings functionality
✅ **PRODUCTION DATA SYNC** - Successfully synced all collections from production to emulator
⚠️ **COMBO DISPLAY ISSUE IDENTIFIED** - Production combo missing display fields

**CURRENT STATUS (September 26, 2025)**:
✅ **Wings Functionality**: Fully restored and working after git revert
✅ **Firebase Emulators**: Running on port 5002 (Functions) and 8080 (Firestore)
✅ **Data Sync**: Production collections (combos, menuItems, sauces) copied to emulator
✅ **Beverages & Sauces**: Working with real production data
❌ **Combos Display**: Shows generic images and missing names/descriptions

**BACKUPS CREATED**:
- `functions/lib-backup-20250926-165529/` - Complete lib directory with enhanced sides modal
- `functions/js-backup-20250926-165656/` - All JavaScript files for comparison

**ROOT PROBLEM**: Production combo data structure incomplete:
```
Missing: name, description, imageUrl, platformPricing
Present: active, badges, basePrice, computedNutrition
```

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**:
1. Reconnect Firebase MCP tools (user reported disconnection)
2. Add missing display fields to production combo data
3. Restore enhanced sides modal functionality from backup
4. Test complete menu functionality

**LATEST UPDATE - September 26, 2025 (Wings Modal Refactoring)**:
🔧 **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE TRANSITION** - Moving from monolithic JavaScript to clean modules
❌ **WINGS MODAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**:
1. Order summary appearing early (should only show at final step)
2. Step 2 sauce selection showing placeholders instead of real content
3. Missing "on the side" sauce selection functionality
4. Incomplete modular implementation missing key functions

**CURRENT DEBUGGING STATUS**:
- ✅ Fixed JavaScript syntax errors (template literal escaping)
- ✅ Fixed missing generateWingVariants function
- ✅ Added complete sauce selection with Firestore data
- ❌ Lost "on the side" toggle functionality during modular refactor
- ❌ Order summary still showing when it shouldn't

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**:
1. Restore complete "on the side" sauce selection functionality
2. Debug why Order Summary section appears early in modal
3. Extract remaining placeholder functions from backup
4. Complete modular architecture while preserving all features
5. Test complete wings ordering flow

**ARCHITECTURE STATUS**:
- Using: `/functions/lib/platforms/doordash/javascript-modular.js`
- Wings Modal: `/functions/lib/platforms/doordash/modules/wings-modal-complete.js`
- Issues: Missing complete implementations from backup file

Wings order flow system partially restored but missing critical "on the side" functionality. Need to complete modular extraction while preserving all features from backup.
