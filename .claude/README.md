## About This Project

- **Type:** Firebase-powered marketing site
- **Purpose:** Drive traffic to delivery platforms
- **Architecture:** Firebase Storage + Firestore + Vanilla JS
- **Business Model:** Platform delivery (DoorDash, UberEats, Grubhub)
- **Key Metrics:** 
  - Platform click-through rate (Sally)
  - FDA compliance status (Erika)
  - Margin after platform fees (Richard)
  - Page load speed & Firebase costs (TomCat65)

## Agent Coordination

The four agents work together as a complete team:
- **Sally** optimizes the customer journey and conversions
- **Erika** ensures all nutrition info is accurate and compliant  
- **Richard** sets profitable prices that beat competition
- **TomCat65** builds the tech that makes it all work

Example workflow: Richard calculates optimal bundle pricing â†’ Sally designs the UI to highlight value â†’ Erika ensures nutrition info is displayed correctly â†’ TomCat65 implements everything with blazing-fast performance.

## Notes

- All agents maintain persistent memory across sessions
- Agents can reference each other's memory files for coordination
- Orders happen on delivery platforms (we don't process payments)
- Focus is on driving profitable platform orders
