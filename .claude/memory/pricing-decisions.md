# Pricing Decisions Log

## 2025-09-17: Initial Platform Pricing Strategy

### Decision: Set 6-wing price at $11.99 on all platforms
**Rationale**: 
- Matches Wingstop's entry price point
- Undercuts Buffalo Wild Wings by $3
- Maintains 54% margin after platform fees
- Psychological pricing under $12 threshold

### Decision: Premium pricing for 12-wing orders
**Set at**: $21.99 (not 2x 6-wing price)
**Why**: Encourages multiple 6-wing orders which have better margins
**Result**: Expected - customers buying 2x 6-wing orders instead

## 2025-01-17: Menu Corrections

### Corrected Menu Structure
**Changes Made**:
- Removed chicken tenders (never existed)
- Removed onion rings (don't offer)
- Removed all sodas (only bottled water)
- Fixed sauce names to match Firebase
- Updated combos to actual offerings

### Actual Combos (Corrected)
1. Game Day 30: $52.99 platform / $34.99 direct
2. The Tailgater: $64.99 platform / $44.99 direct
3. MVP Meal: $32.99 platform / $22.99 direct
4. Sampler Platter: $19.99 platform / $13.99 direct
5. Party Pack 50: $109.99 platform / $74.99 direct

## 2025-09-15: Combo Introduction

### Wing Combo #1 Launch
**Price**: $16.99 (wings + fries + drink)
**Strategy**: 
- Only $4 more than wings alone
- Increases average order value
- Fries/drink have 70%+ margins
- Beats competitor combo prices by $2-3

## 2025-09-10: Sauce Upcharge Test

### Test: $0.50 extra for premium sauces
**Result**: 89% still ordered premium sauces
**Decision**: Keep upcharge, adds $0.35 net per order
**Learning**: Customers value flavor variety over price

## 2025-09-08: Happy Hour Pricing

### 3-6 PM Weekday Special
**Offer**: 20% off wings only (not combos)
**Platform implementation**: Used promo codes
**Result**: 
- 45% increase in 3-6 PM orders
- Still profitable at ~38% margins
- Helped kitchen load balancing

## Key Principles Established

1. **Never go below 35% margin** - Even during promotions
2. **Push small orders** - Better per-unit economics  
3. **Bundle strategically** - High-margin sides offset wing costs
4. **Time-based pricing works** - Customers accept different prices
5. **Platform parity important** - Same prices across all three

## Failed Experiments

### BOGO Tuesdays (discontinued after 2 weeks)
- Attracted deal-seekers only
- No customer retention
- Margins dropped to 22%
- Kitchen overwhelmed

### $99 Party Pack
- Too expensive for platform delivery
- Customers went direct to competitors
- Only sold 3 in one month

## 2025-10-14: New Menu Categories - Pricing Authorization

### Desserts - Price Adjustments (Richard's Analysis)

  - COGS: $1.94/slice (Chef's Quality, 14 slices per cake)

  - COGS: $2.50/slice (Bindi, 14 slices)
  - Platform: $6.41 DD/UE, $5.77 GH

## Richard's Key Principles - October 2025

1. **Margin Targets**: 45-55% net after ALL platform fees (minimum 35% for promotions)
2. **Premium Positioning**: Quality ingredients justify higher pricing (Bindi, Chef's Quality)
3. **Value Perception**: Plant-based positioned below boneless = strong value proposition
4. **Category Strategy**:
   - Desserts: High-margin items (Daisy's 88-92%) offset premium cakes (40-54%)
   - Cold Sides: Excellent performers (56-66%) for upsell opportunities
   - Fresh Salads: 40-50% acceptable for perishable health-conscious items
5. **Psychological Pricing**: $8.99, $15.99, $27.99 structures maintain under-threshold appeal
