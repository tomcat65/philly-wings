# Session Log — 2025‑09‑20 (Philly Wings Express)

## Summary
- Synced menu data across Firestore, site JSON, seeds, and admin.
- Generated Storage manifest and audits; fixed missing assets; enabled WebP rollout.
- Corrected combo images/text (Tailgater, Game Day 30) everywhere.
- Hardened WebP client code; allowed nested Storage reads; prepared derivative sweep.
- Cleaned repo references; added icons and tiny story endpoint to public; fixed rules/indexes.
 - Preview audit (mobile) completed post‑deploy; favicon/manifest warnings resolved; site now serves WebP across sections (non‑WebP count 0, broken 0).

## Firestore
- menuItems: kept `wings`; added/updated base items:
  - `fries` (regular/large/loaded)
  - `mozzarella_sticks` (4/6/8/12/16)
  - `drinks` (water-bottle)
- combos:
  - `combo-game-day-30` description updated → now includes 2 large fries + 8 mozz sticks; items updated.
- nutritionData: verified 12/24/30/50 and dips; no changes needed.
- Rules: variant-based schema for `menuItems` and `combos` (removed legacy `price` requirement; allow `variants`/`basePrice`).
- Indexes: added composites for `reviews`, `gameDayBanners`, `liveOrders`, `combos`, `menuItems`.

## Storage
- Bucket: `philly-wings.firebasestorage.app`.
- Manifest: `docs/firebase/storage-manifest.md|json` (now 137 objects)
- Audits:
  - Link 404s: fixed (live content clean)
  - WebP coverage: initially 1 miss → resolved; homepage still has a few filenames without derivatives.
- Uploaded assets:
  - Dips: `images/blue-cheese.png`, `cheese-sauce.png`, `honey-mustard.png`, `ranch-dip.png`
  - Water bottle (sport cap): `images/water-bottle.png` and `.jpg`, derivatives present
- Storage rules: changed to allow nested paths `match /images/{allPaths=**}` to enable `/images/resized/*` reads.
 - Verified `images/resized/*_800x800.webp` (and 200x200/1920x1080 where applicable) exist for all sauces/combos referenced.

## Site & Admin
- public/data/combos.json:
  - Added Game Day 30; updated description/items; Tailgater image fixed
- index.html:
  - Game Day 30 card text updated; absolute `/scripts.js`, tiny story endpoint auto-loads
- Admin (admin/menu-master.js): Game Day 30 description/includes updated
- Seed scripts: `seed-test-data.js` and `seed-with-admin.js` combos updated
- PDF (menu-pdf.html): Game Day 30 text updated
- WebP client code: src/services/webp-image-service.js hardened to avoid recursion and ensure swap
- Combos fetch: cache bust + `no-store` to avoid stale JSON
 - Favicon/manifest: removed temporary redirect in `firebase.json`; manifest icons load direct (200 OK).
 - WebP direct links: replaced PNGs with WebP derivatives where static (index.html quick picks, gallery, sides, wing-type icons).
 - sauces.json: switched all sauce images to WebP derivatives.
 - combos.json: switched all combo images to WebP derivatives; confirmed live preview loads WebP URLs.
 - WebP client enhancement: added MutationObserver to auto‑swap dynamically injected images.

## Public assets
- Copied root icons into `public/`: android-chrome-192/512, apple-touch-icon, favicons
- Added tiny content endpoint at `public/api/content/our-story`
- Added `public/scripts.js` for `/scripts.js` path

## Hosting
- firebase.json: removed temporary redirect for `/android-chrome-192x192.png`; icons served from root without redirect.

## GitHub / CI
- Pushed via admin PR; preview built via GH Action (npm ci → npm run build → deploy preview)
- Pending: add CI audit job (manifest, link 404, WebP) to PRs

## Open Items / Next Steps
1) Hosting canonical: set 301 apex → https://www.phillywingsexpress.com (preserve path/query) in Hosting UI or firebase.json
2) Nutrition: verify/create `nutritionData` docs for 12/24/30/50 wings and sides/combos noted
3) Published menu flow: enforce immutable snapshots (`publishedMenus` allow create only), add export/backup utility
4) Admin access: ensure `customClaims.admin=true` for admin accounts
5) CI audits: add PR job for storage manifest, link 404s, WebP coverage

## Nutrition Combos – Implementation Snapshot (PR: nutrition, preview pr3)

- Admin compute path
  - Added combo editor fields: `servingsPerCombo`, `saucePolicy`, `representativeSauceId`, `saucePortionRule` (JSON), `disclaimer`.
  - On Save (combos) computes `computedNutrition` (perCombo, perServing, allergens union, breakdown, sauceNote, lastComputedAt) and writes to `combos/{id}`.
  - Recompute button in Platform Menu: iterates combos, recomputes, persists `computedNutrition`; uploads `public/combos-nutrition.json` (to be gated/CF later).

- Modal updates (site)
  - Prefers `combos/{id}.computedNutrition`.
  - Fallbacks: compute from Firestore combos `items[]` → lastly from static `/data/combos.json`.
  - Renders “What’s inside” breakdown, sauce note, disclaimer; per-combo/per-serving toggle supported for computed combos.

- Sauce nutrition
  - 6 per‑ounce sauce docs added to `nutritionData` (category `sauces`): `mild-buffalo-1oz`, `bbq-1oz`, `garlic-parm-1oz`, `honey-mustard-1oz`, `ranch-1oz`, `blue-cheese-1oz`.
  - Representative sauce logic adds per‑oz values per `saucePortionRule` (e.g., 1 oz per 6 wings).

- Firebase
  - Firestore rules updated: `isAdmin()` accepts boolean or string claim; deployed.
  - Preview recompute: Firestore now readable; Storage upload still 403 → not blocking once gated.

- Recommendation / Next
  - Short term: gate Storage upload with `VITE_ENABLE_NUTRITION_FEED_UPLOAD=false`; recompute succeeds on Firestore only.
  - Mid term: move feed generation to Cloud Function (on combos/nutritionData changes + callable for manual recompute).
  - UX: replace alert with toast; note when feed upload is skipped.
