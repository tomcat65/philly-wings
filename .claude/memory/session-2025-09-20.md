# Session Log — 2025‑09‑20 (Philly Wings Express)

## Summary
- Synced menu data across Firestore, site JSON, seeds, and admin.
- Generated Storage manifest and audits; fixed missing assets; enabled WebP rollout.
- Corrected combo images/text (Tailgater, Game Day 30) everywhere.
- Hardened WebP client code; allowed nested Storage reads; prepared derivative sweep.
- Cleaned repo references; added icons and tiny story endpoint to public; fixed rules/indexes.

## Firestore
- menuItems: kept `wings`; added/updated base items:
  - `fries` (regular/large/loaded)
  - `mozzarella_sticks` (4/6/8/12/16)
  - `drinks` (water-bottle)
- combos:
  - `combo-game-day-30` description updated → now includes 2 large fries + 8 mozz sticks; items updated.
- nutritionData: verified 12/24/30/50 and dips; no changes needed.
- Rules: variant-based schema for `menuItems` and `combos` (removed legacy `price` requirement; allow `variants`/`basePrice`).
- Indexes: added composites for `reviews`, `gameDayBanners`, `liveOrders`, `combos`, `menuItems`.

## Storage
- Bucket: `philly-wings.firebasestorage.app`.
- Manifest: `docs/firebase/storage-manifest.md|json` (now 137 objects)
- Audits:
  - Link 404s: fixed (live content clean)
  - WebP coverage: initially 1 miss → resolved; homepage still has a few filenames without derivatives.
- Uploaded assets:
  - Dips: `images/blue-cheese.png`, `cheese-sauce.png`, `honey-mustard.png`, `ranch-dip.png`
  - Water bottle (sport cap): `images/water-bottle.png` and `.jpg`, derivatives present
- Storage rules: changed to allow nested paths `match /images/{allPaths=**}` to enable `/images/resized/*` reads.

## Site & Admin
- public/data/combos.json:
  - Added Game Day 30; updated description/items; Tailgater image fixed
- index.html:
  - Game Day 30 card text updated; absolute `/scripts.js`, tiny story endpoint auto-loads
- Admin (admin/menu-master.js): Game Day 30 description/includes updated
- Seed scripts: `seed-test-data.js` and `seed-with-admin.js` combos updated
- PDF (menu-pdf.html): Game Day 30 text updated
- WebP client code: src/services/webp-image-service.js hardened to avoid recursion and ensure swap
- Combos fetch: cache bust + `no-store` to avoid stale JSON

## Public assets
- Copied root icons into `public/`: android-chrome-192/512, apple-touch-icon, favicons
- Added tiny content endpoint at `public/api/content/our-story`
- Added `public/scripts.js` for `/scripts.js` path

## Hosting
- firebase.json: added temporary redirect for `/android-chrome-192x192.png` (safe but superfluous once icons ship)

## GitHub / CI
- Pushed via admin PR; preview built via GH Action (npm ci → npm run build → deploy preview)
- Pending: add CI audit job (manifest, link 404, WebP) to PRs

## Open Items / Next Steps
1) WebP derivative sweep for homepage assets
   - Create/upload missing `_1920x1080`, `_800x800`, `_200x200` for any on-page filenames lacking derivatives so client swaps succeed universally.
2) PWA manifest icon list → align to public/ filenames to remove icon warning.
3) Published menu flow: enforce immutable snapshots (`publishedMenus` allow create only), add export utility.
4) Ensure admin users have `customClaims.admin=true` for rule compliance.
5) Optional: export Firestore collections to backups after seeding.
