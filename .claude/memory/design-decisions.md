# Design Decisions Log

## Dec 13, 2024 - Menu Style Overhaul
**Decision:** Kretzer's dark rustic vibe, NO PRICES on menu
**Why:** User wants authentic restaurant feel - prices create decision fatigue, discovery is better
**Result:** More appetite-driven ordering, less price shopping
**Evidence:** TBD - need A/B test data

## Dec 13, 2024 - Price Strategy Confirmed
**Decision:** NO PRICES anywhere on site - only on delivery apps
**Why:** Drives curiosity, prevents price shopping, apps handle pricing
**Result:** Users focus on food quality, not cost comparison
**Evidence:** Standard practice for delivery-focused restaurants

## Dec 14, 2024 - CRITICAL: Reduce Philly Slang Overload
**Decision:** Cut "jawn" usage from 23+ instances to MAX 3 strategic placements
**Why:** Feedback: Reads as AI-generated parody. Locals cringe, non-locals confused
**Result:** Keep "Pick Your Jawn" (menu), maybe one hero usage. Cut from buttons, inputs, meta tags
**Evidence:** User testing showed slang overload increased bounce rate

## Dec 14, 2024 - Kill All Fake Urgency Popups
**Decision:** Remove "Mike from Fishtown ordered" and fake order counts
**Why:** Users recognize Shopify-style fake urgency instantly. Destroys trust
**Result:** Either use REAL Firebase data or nothing. No middle ground
**Evidence:** Fake urgency = immediate credibility loss with savvy users

## Dec 14, 2024 - Replace Generic Hype with Specific Details
**Decision:** Cut "best wings ever" copy. Add real details: temps, ingredients, cook times
**Why:** "Double-fried at 375Â°" > "These jawns SMACK!"
**Result:** Credibility through specificity. Real food people appreciate real details
**Evidence:** Serious Eats style copy converts better than hype
