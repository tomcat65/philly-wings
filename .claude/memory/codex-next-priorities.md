# Codex Memory ‚Äî Next Priorities (Philly Wings Express)

## Context Snapshot
- Hosting: apex now points to Firebase; www works. Add 301 apex ‚Üí www (Hosting UI or firebase.json). SSL will auto‚Äëprovision for both.
- Firestore: combos, sauces, modifierGroups, nutrition, nutritionData present. menuItems now seeded with `wings` doc.
- Storage: Bucket `philly-wings.firebasestorage.app` confirmed. Official MCP previously could fetch individual objects; this session it did not load. WebP pipeline active (`images/resized/*`).

## MCP Policy (Important)
- Primary: Use Community Firebase MCP for Firestore writes/reads (confirmed working).
- Storage reads: Prefer Official Firebase MCP when available; if it fails to load, proceed with known URLs and/or request `gsutil` manifest dump when approved.

## Artifacts for Current State
- Markdown report: `docs/firebase/STATUS.md`
- JSON snapshot: `backups/firebase-snapshot.json`

## Session Summary (2025‚Äë09‚Äë20)
- Official Firebase MCP did not load in this run; Community MCP worked.
- Verified Firestore connectivity and listed root collections.
- Seeded menuItems: kept `wings`; added `fries`, `mozzarella_sticks` (incl. 4/6/8/12/16), `drinks` (water-bottle). Synced IDs with web JSON.
- Docs/backups updated to reflect 4 menu items.
- Generated full Storage manifest via gcloud and audits (link and WebP). Uploaded dips (blue-cheese/cheese-sauce/honey-mustard/ranch-dip) and correct sport‚Äëcap water-bottle; fixed stale images.
- Fixed repo references (remaps) so live content 404 audit is green. Added tiny content endpoint `public/api/content/our-story`.
- Combos: added Game Day 30 to web JSON, corrected Tailgater image, updated Game Day 30 copy (adds 2 large fries + 8 mozz sticks) across site components, seeds, and menu PDF; updated Firestore combo doc.
- WebP rollout: hardened client interceptor; enabled nested Storage rule `/images/**`; prepared homepage derivative sweep; manifest now shows many WebP derivatives present.

## To‚ÄëDos

### 1) Seed Menu Items (Firestore)
- Done: `wings`, `fries`, `mozzarella_sticks` (4/6/8/12/16), `drinks` (water-bottle) seeded and verified.

### 2) Combos ‚Äî Align JSON + Firestore
- Done: Game Day 30 added and copy synced; Tailgater image fixed; Firestore combo updated. Optional: add Date Night Dozen.

### 3) Nutrition Data
- Verify docs exist in `nutritionData` for: `12-wings`, `24-wings`, `30-wings`, `50-wings` (6‚Äëwings present).
- Confirm sides/combos entries: `french-fries`, `loaded-fries`, `mozzarella-sticks`, `mvp-meal`.

### 4) Storage Manifest & WebP Audit
- Done: Manifest + audits generated; nested Storage rule deployed for `/images/**`.
- Done: homepage derivative coverage verified; direct WebP links patched in `index.html`, `public/data/sauces.json`, and `public/data/combos.json`. Preview audit shows 0 non‚ÄëWebP, 0 broken.

### 5) Hosting Canonical Redirect ‚Äî Resolved
- Decision: Keep apex serving directly (no apex‚Üíwww 301). SSL for both apex and www is provisioned.

### 6) Backups / Guardrails
- Export Firestore after seeding: `menuItems`, `combos`, `sauces`, `modifierGroups`, `nutritionData`.
- (Optional) Add admin export/import for menus (admin‚Äëonly) for quick restore.

### 7) Admin Writes / Rules / Indexes
- Done: firestore.rules updated for variant schema; composite indexes added; storage.rules nested path enabled. Ensure admin customClaims.

### 8) PWA Icons & Manifest
- Done: copied icons to `public/`. Next: align manifest icon paths with these filenames to remove warnings.

### 9) CI Audits
- Add a GH Action to run: storage manifest, link 404 audit, WebP audit on PR.

## Proposed Next Steps (Execution Plan)
1) Verify/create missing `nutritionData` docs for 12/24/30/50 and sides/combos.
2) CI: add PR audit job (manifest, link 404s, WebP coverage).
3) Backups: export Firestore collections (`menuItems`, `combos`, `sauces`, `modifierGroups`, `nutritionData`).
4) (If needed) Seed any straggler `menuItems` variants via admin panel.

Owner: Codex
Last updated: 2025‚Äë09‚Äë20 (WebP coverage 100% on preview; favicon/manifest fixed)
- Nutrition combos rollout (admin + site)
  - Gate JSON feed upload via `VITE_ENABLE_NUTRITION_FEED_UPLOAD` (default false in preview).
  - Replace recompute alert with toast; show success even if feed skipped.
  - Implement Cloud Function:
    - onWrite(combos/*, nutritionData/*): recompute `computedNutrition` and publish feed; bump version.
    - callable: manual recompute/publish from Admin.
  - Optional: always prefer Firestore for modal; keep static JSON as final fallback only.

## 2025‚Äë09‚Äë20 ‚Äî Nutrition Preview Updates (Deployed)

What we shipped
- Admin flag gating for combos nutrition feed upload (skips Storage; Firestore only).
- Toast UX replacing alert on recompute (success even when upload skipped).
- Deep sanitizer before Firestore `updateDoc` to remove undefined/NaN/Infinity.
- Logos for platform tabs added to `public/images/logos/` (removes 404s).

Files modified
- `admin/platform-menu.js` ‚Äî gating, sanitizer, toast, serialization fix.
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` ‚Äî doc for `VITE_ENABLE_NUTRITION_FEED_UPLOAD`.
- `public/images/logos/{doordash,ubereats,grubhub}-logo.svg` ‚Äî added.

Verification (Preview pr3)
- Recompute updates `combos/*`.computedNutrition without client Storage; no updateDoc warnings.
- Upload skip logs present; no Storage PUTs.
- Platform logos render in UI.

Next tasks
1) Cloud Functions
   - `onWrite` triggers for `combos/*` and `nutritionData/*` to recompute `computedNutrition` and publish JSON atomically; bump a version.
   - `callable` function to allow Admin button to run server‚Äëside recompute/publish.
2) CI audits on PR (Storage manifest diff, link 404 check, WebP coverage report).
3) Backups: export core collections (`menuItems`, `combos`, `sauces`, `modifierGroups`, `nutritionData`).
4) Optional: Admin import/export tools for menus; content seeding automation.

## 2025‚Äë09‚Äë20 ‚Äî Platform Menus, Modifiers, Dips, and Publish Pipeline (Completed)

Scope
- Clean up MVP Meal duplicate; enforce combo pricing & order.
- Split Dips from Sauces in Admin; encode per‚Äë6 wing allowances (sauces, dips, sauce‚Äëon‚Äëside, cuts, boneless/classic).
- Consolidate Sides for partner export (single item + Portion Size modifier).
- Add Admin buttons for Preview JSON, Download JSON, and publish via Cloud Function to Storage (Versioned + Latest URL).

Files touched
- `admin/platform-menu.js`
  - Added allowance helpers: `getWingsCountFromItem`, `getWingsCountFromComboItems`, `computeWingAllowancesByCount`, `getModifierPricingMeta`.
  - Default wing variant `modifierGroups`: `['wing_type','wing_cut','sauce_choice','extra_sauces','extra_dips']`.
  - Inline Allowances panel in editor (wings/combos): shows sets‚Äëof‚Äë6, allowed sauces, included sauce cups, included dips, extra cup prices, wing cut surcharge, and floor rule text.
  - Split Sauces vs Dips in Admin UI rendering (`menuData.dips`, `#dips-items`).
  - Ensured modifier groups loaded/created (and upserted to Firestore):
    - `sauce_choice`: per‚Äë6 rules, includes ‚ÄúOriginal (No Sauce)‚Äù, on‚Äëside doesn‚Äôt count against dips.
    - `extra_sauces`: price per cup ($1.00), included per 6 = 0.
    - `extra_dips`: included per 6 = 2; price per extra = $1.25; options sourced from dips.
    - `wing_type`: classic | boneless (required).
    - `wing_cut`: mix | all_drums | all_flats; surchargePer6 = $1.50; appliesTo classic only.
  - Platform export snapshot (`buildCompleteMenuSnapshot`):
    - Adds `platformExport.consolidated` with:
      - `sides`: consolidated item per side with required `portion_size` modifier (4/8/12/16) using price deltas.
      - `wingsSplitRules`: per‚Äë6 allowances & pricing for sauces, dips, wing cuts, classic/boneless.
      - `combos`: includes `flexibleComponents` enabling fries substitutions (regular/large/loaded) and add/remove sides/drinks, and `wingsCount`.
    - Includes `allowances` per wings/combos item in `snapshot.items[...]` for downstream clients.
  - Publishing flow hardening:
    - Deep sanitize snapshot before writes, re‚Äëapply `serverTimestamp()` after sanitize.
    - Added `previewPlatformJSON`, `downloadPlatformJSON`, `publishToStorage` (callable) actions; exposed on `window.*`.
  - Sorting: combos sorted by `sortOrder` for stable presentation.

- `admin/platform-menu.html`
  - Added Quick Action buttons: `üß™ Preview Platform JSON`, `‚¨áÔ∏è Download JSON`, `‚òÅÔ∏è Publish to Storage`.
  - Added Dips section (`ü´ô Dips`) with item count.

- `src/firebase-config.js`
  - Exported `functions = getFunctions(app)` for callable.

- `functions/index.js` (NEW)
  - Callable `publishPlatformMenu` (admin‚Äëonly) writes versioned and latest JSON under `platform-menus/{platform}/` in Storage and records metadata in `publishedMenus/{platform‚Äëtimestamp}`. Returns Versioned + Latest URLs (firebasestorage endpoints).

- `functions/package.json` (NEW)
  - Node 18 engines, dependencies: `firebase-admin`, `firebase-functions`.

- `storage.rules`
  - Added public read for `platform-menus/**`; admin write.

- `firebase.json`
  - Added `"functions": { "source": "functions" }` to enable function deployment.

- Documentation/backups updated earlier in this session when deduping MVP:
  - `docs/firebase/STATUS.md`: combos reduced to 5; duplicated MVP removed.
  - `backups/firebase-snapshot.json`: combos count adjusted; legacy MVP removed.

Firestore changes
- Combos (dedupe + pricing + order):
  - Deleted legacy docs: `combos/D1F7cvfjgfMyEfPrdvBE` (mvp_meal), `3yhbryADluFsEx8O2xdU` (sampler_platter), `m8XgnkYctZlA44j4wJbo` (game_day_30), `TkYtV7xlPbM06W71Ex8D` (party_pack_50), `fEAlRAD4aWoWGlf6PCiy` (the_tailgater).
  - Kept canonical web docs and set:
    - `LHVOJwNbXNuXOZbpHtGO` (combo‚Äëmvp): basePrice 17.99, sortOrder 1.
    - `Qzhmx3q9twaSR62M0R7l` (combo‚Äësampler): basePrice 18.99, sortOrder 0.
    - `VQBQJsNsTPSdM3jUSuFm` (combo‚Äëtailgater): basePrice 47.99, sortOrder 2.
    - `Mwp2hJceFkGrFKgmIQKX` (combo‚Äëgame‚Äëday‚Äë30): basePrice 35.99, sortOrder 3.
    - `iKGdzL0l3zjB3JZ6VegH` (combo‚Äëparty‚Äëpack): basePrice 104.99, sortOrder 4.
  - Platform pricing set: GH lower for certain combos (Tailgater, Party Pack, Sampler, Game Day).

- Mozzarella Sticks variants (sides): removed 6‚Äëcount; confirmed 4/8/12/16 only (with per‚Äëplatform pricing). Admin still lists variants; platform export consolidates via size modifier.

- Modifiers (created/upserted): `sauce_choice`, `extra_sauces`, `extra_dips`, `wing_type`, `wing_cut` with per‚Äë6 metadata and prices.

Admin UX changes
- Allowances panel in item editor for wings & combos (computed per sets of 6; floor rule for 50 wings).
- Modifier Editor modal renders and persists the 5 groups; supports tuning per‚Äë6 counts and per‚Äëcup/per‚Äëextra pricing.
- Dips appear as their own Admin category and are available as paid add‚Äëons.

Publish & links
- Short‚Äëterm Firestore writes were hardened (sanitize + re‚Äëapply timestamps) but switched to Cloud Function publish to Storage for a robust partner‚Äëfacing link.
- Callable function deployed (`us‚Äëcentral1`). Admin button returns:
  - Versioned JSON URL: `.../platform-menus/{platform}/{timestamp}.json?alt=media`
  - Latest JSON URL: `.../platform-menus/{platform}/latest.json?alt=media` (stable link to share with partners).

Decisions & policies
- Public site is a marketing showcase; partner menus and logic live in the platform export.
- Categories for partners: Wings (6/12/24/30/50), Sauces (modifiers only), Dips (own category and add‚Äëon), Sides (consolidated), Drinks, Combos.
- Wings remain separate SKUs to keep per‚Äë6 allowances straightforward for partner ingestion.
- Combos support substitutions and add/remove with price deltas.

Open items / Next actions
1) Deploy path already in place. Validate Admin ‚Äú‚òÅÔ∏è Publish to Storage‚Äù now returns Versioned + Latest URLs and share Latest with partners.
2) Optional: Add a small ‚ÄúCopy URL‚Äù button in publish modal.
3) Optional: CI to auto‚Äëpublish `latest.json` on main‚Äëbranch merges (GitHub Actions calling the callable).
4) Upgrade Cloud Functions runtime to Node 20 and `firebase-functions` to v5+ (breaking changes likely) before 2025‚Äë10‚Äë30.
5) Consider pinning client Functions region (e.g., `getFunctions(app, 'us-central1')`) to match deployed region.
6) Optional: Add `extra_dips` modifier to relevant sides as paid add‚Äëon if partners want dips exposed alongside sides.
7) Keep backups: run Firestore export for `menuItems`, `combos`, `sauces`, `modifierGroups`, `nutritionData`.
