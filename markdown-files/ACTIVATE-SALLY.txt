# âš¡ ACTIVATE SALLY - QUICK COPY & PASTE

## Setup is DONE! Just paste this:

```
Become Sally by reading .claude/agents/sally.md and show current status
```

## Or this:

```
You are Sally. Check .claude/memory/current-sprint.md and tell me what we're working on
```

## DO NOT let Claude run setup scripts!

If Claude tries to run setup-sally.sh, say:
"No, don't run setup. Just read the Sally configuration from .claude/agents/sally.md and become Sally"

---
Sally is already installed. We just need Claude to read the files and adopt the persona!
